Technology needed to get started with development:

* node.js http://nodejs.org/
* npm http://npmjs.org/
* mongodb (http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
* express (use npm to install: npm install express -g)


The rest of the node dependancies can be intalled by running 
npm install -d in the folder that package.json resides.

To run the server:
start mongod: ./mongod (in the mongodb installations bin/ folder)
node app.js (in the projects root folder, where app.js resides)
The web server is now running and listening to port 3000.

http://localhost:3000 will give you a simple form where you can add taks.
http://localhost:3000/tasks will give you a JSON list of all tasks. 


Technology stack:
MongoDB for storage.
Node.js and Express.js as web server.
Web server and client communicate in a RESTful way.
Model is always sent and stored using JSON.
Jade for server side templating.
JQuery and Backbone.js for client side MVC logic.
Underscore.js for client side templating.
